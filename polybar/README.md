# Instructions

Read the wiki in the polybar github

My launch scripts contains code for multiple screens, a normal example can be found on the wiki.
To make to i3 workspace icons work properly on multimonitor you have to bind them to a screen in the i3 config.

Bluetooth and Nordvpn are custom modules, check the scripts folder for the scripts that are used

The font I use is Hack Nerd Font (ttf-nerd-fonts-hack on AUR I think)
The others are mainly backup fonts

I thinks this explains most of It, feel free the ask if you have any question, but first check the wik :D.
