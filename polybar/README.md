# Instructions

Read the wiki in the polybar github

My launch scripts contains code for multiple screens, and normal example can be found on the wiki.
To make to i3 workspace icons work properly you on multimonitor you sould bind them in the i3 config.

Bluetooth and Nordvpn are custom modules, check the scripts folder for the scripts that are used

The font I use is Hack Nerd Font (ttf-nerd-fonts-hack on AUR I think)
The others are mainly backup fonts

I thinks this explains most of It, feel free the ask if you have any question, but first check the wik :D.
